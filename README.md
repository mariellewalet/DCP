# DCP : Daily Coding Problems 

This website [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) sends problems daily to be solved. 
They help with interview questions and helps me grow my problem solving techniques and improve my coding skills. 

Why am I doing these? 
- **Improve my coding skills** : I was looking for small coding problems in order to improve my Python skills as I was just starting to teach it myself. I'm also trying to improve my coding style, more efficient and concise.
- **Problem solving** : Problem solving is something that I truly enjoy. By solving one problem, you may be able to solve another one. So the more I do, the more I can solve. Simple. It's a skill that always need to be worked on. 
- **Challenge** : Like I said before, I love solving problems and giving myself challenges. 

The problems are numbered based on how they come in my inbox. You can read the problem in the file.
